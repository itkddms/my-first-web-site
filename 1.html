    I missed your 21st birthday
    I've been up at home
    Almost tried to call you, don't know if I should
    Hate to picture you half-drunk, happy
    Hate to think you went out without me
    I'm sorry if you blame me, if I were you I would
    Thought you'd see it coming, but you never could
    I still haven't heard from your family
    But you said your mom always loved me
    <img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">
    </p><p style="margin-top: 40px;">Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
    Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
    Lights on and it's black and white, I couldn't stay forever
    I see the look in your eye and I'm biting my tongue
    You'd be the love of my life when I was young
    When the night is over
    Don't call me up I'm already under
    I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again
    I'll be the love of your life inside your head
    When the night is over
    Don't call me up I'm already under </p>
